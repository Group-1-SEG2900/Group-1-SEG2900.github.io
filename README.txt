Deliverable 1:
Product / Service Name:
Brief Description: A social app that directly connects people who are at the same event through photo and video sharing. 
Users can share their experience/perspective at specific events (concerts, sports games, conferences, etc.) and have an 
insight into people from the same crowd in real-time (or after). Events are split into categories ("folders") for 
other users to find content and other attendees in one place. (Content is also public for non-event goers unless the
folder is made private by the event holder/company).
